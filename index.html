        <h1>CodeBase</h1>
        <p>A <code style="font-size: 25px;">codebase</code>  (sometimes spelled as two words, code base) is the complete body of source code for
             a given software program or application. <br>
            <p>
                 In <mark>software development</mark>, a codebase (or code base) is a <mark>collection of source code</mark> used to 
             build a particular <mark>software system</mark>, <mark>application</mark>, or <mark>software component</mark>. Typically, a codebase
              includes only human-written source code files; thus, a codebase usually does not include
               source code files generated by tools (generated files) or binary library files 
               (object files), as they can be built from the human-written source code. However,
                it generally does include configuration and property files, as they are the data necessary 
                for the build.
            </p>

        <p>Source code is the version of a program that a programmer writes and saves as a file. 
            After the code is compiled preparatory to running on a computer, the program exists as 
            object code, which the computer understands but a human cannot without a great deal of 
            difficulty. The source code is retained, either as a collection of files or in a source
             control repository, so that changes can be made as necessary throughout the software's 
             supported life.
        </p>
        <p>
            A codebase is typically stored in a source control repository in a version control system.
            For smaller projects it may be kept as a simple set of files (even the Linux kernel was maintained
            as a set of files for many years). A source code repository is a place where large 
            amounts of source code are kept, either publicly or privately. Source code repositories are
            used most basically for backups and versioning, and on multi-developer projects to handle various
            source code versions and to provide aid in resolving conflicts that arise from developers submitting
            overlapping modifications. Subversion, Git and Mercurial are examples of popular tools used
            to handle this workflow, which are common in open source projects.

                Codebase management really starts with the creation of the code in the first place.
                 The quality of the programming, adherence to best practices and adequate commenting 
                 can make the codebase much easier to maintain.

                Developers can save and retrieve different development versions of source code in a version
                 control system, which also allows development teams to share control of different versions
                  of files in the common source code repository. The system maintains a single copy of
                   the codebase and a record of any changes. When a specific version is requested, the 
                   version control system reconstructs it from that information.
